/**
 * Prefix rewriting for mirrored sites.
 *
 * A site built with one base (Bahnhof builds with `/Bahnhof/`) cannot also be
 * served under a mirror prefix (`/repo/isui.ren-Bahnhof/`) from the same build:
 * its root-absolute asset URLs point at the other mount. This module makes one
 * HTML document resolve under a prefix, and it is the single implementation —
 * the edge middleware imports the build of this file directly, so there is no
 * second copy to drift.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately: a `<base>` element plus root-absolute references to the
 * repository's own subpath. `srcset`, CSS `url()`, and paths assembled inside
 * JavaScript are out of scope; the mirrored sites are first-party builds whose
 * two shapes (relative and root-absolute) are known.
